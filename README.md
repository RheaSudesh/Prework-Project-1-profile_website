# Profile_Website

This project is to make a clone of the Profile webpage for every ProGrad with their personal Portfolio and details using HTML and CSS. Its a complete Front-end project to understand the depths of HTML and CSS in detail.


Built the page following a 3 step routine.

➡ Step 1: Create the skeleton of the page (Using HTML)

➡ Step 2: Style the page (Using CSS)

➡ Step 3: Complete the page by positioning the elements appropriately (Again using CSS)
